# Distance-vector-routing
Java project implementing distance vector routing

Instructions:
1. Navigate the command prompt path to the project folder
2. key in the command “javac *.java” to compile the program and create their respective class files.
3. To run the program, input the command
  “java DistanceVectorRouting NetworkNodeName.txt”
  i.e., for executing the node at “a”, -à“java DistanceVectorRouting a.txt”
  Repeat the step 3 mentioned above for each node b, c, d, e ,f on different terminals.
4.Then few iterations can be observed at each node receiving routing tables from the neighbours.
5.After some successful iterations, the routing table data at each node will become constant and the network becomes stable.
6. Network changes can be tested by changing the weights in the .txt files and removing neighbours from a node .txt 
  file to delete that node.
